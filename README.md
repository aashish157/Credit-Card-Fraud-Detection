# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
ML model to classify credit card transactions as genuine or fraudulent

A Linear Regression ML model to predict the monetary value of a new house. Boston house price dataset was used in developing this project. Linear regression is a supervised machine learning algorithm which outputs a linear relation between a dependent and an independent variable. In this project the target attribute 'price' is the dependent variable and feature 'LSTAT' is the independent variable
