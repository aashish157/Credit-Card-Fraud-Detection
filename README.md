# Credit Card Fraud Detection
A `Gaussian Naive Bayes` ML classifier to classify credit card transactions as genuine or fraudulent. Credit card fraud detection dataset from kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud) was used in developing this project. Gaussian Naive Bayes is a classification machine learning algorithm which is an extension of Naive Bayes algorithm. Gaussian Naive Bayes is applied to data with real valued features.
